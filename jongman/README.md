## p148~p150

this problem is making combination

and I solve this problem with recrusion like dfs :laughing:



## p150_boggle

I think this problem can be solved like bfs and I did it because this problem has 5x5 matrix

so that is not consideration O(n)



## p155_picnic

when I see this problen I think it can be solved like combination

not bad but not good


## p159_boardcover

well..... I want to solve this problem with recursion but python can't solve that problem because that has recursion limit
so I read answer :crying:
